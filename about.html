            Introduction
          </h3>
          <p>
            I am a web developer with a passion for technology and enjoy challenging myself to learn new things to
            expand my skillset, enabling me to adapt throughout my journey as a developer. I have a great
            sense of responsibility and the ability to maintain and exhibit the traditional values of achieving results.

            Experience
          </h3>
          <p>
            I started creating websites in the early 2000's as personal projects. Since then, I have worked on a
            number of different websites, with a few years of experience as a solo developer. Take a look at my
            portfolio to see what I have done.

            Hobbies
          </h3>
          <h4><em>Gaming</em></h4>
          <p>
            I am a big gamer, from AAA to solo indie titles. One of my favourite
            developers are FromSoftware with BloodBorne being one of my top games of all time.
          </p>
          <p>
            I started to learn how to make games in 2014. I would play around with Unreal Engine but was soon
            overwhelmed with
            the amount there was to learn. I learned the basics during my free time and continued until I
            developed my first small game. It was a platform type, navigating a ball around an obstacle course. It was a
            huge personal achievement. Since then, I have developed my skills further and worked on a number of
            different mobile games for charity.
          </p>


          <h4><em>Sport</em></h4>
          <p>
            As a England and Harlequins supporter, my main sport is Rugby. Not much gets me away from technology but,
            watching the Six Nations is one of the most exciting sporting events. I also enjoy watching the Football
            World Cup, Summer
            Olympic Games and the Ashes Cricket.
